    <h1>HOW TO MAKE A PAPER BUTTER FLY</h1>
    <h2>Using an easy-to-follow tutorial, you can learn how to make a <br>
       little origami butterfly. It's a traditional origami model that <br>
       is a good introduction to the art of paper folding popularized <br>
       by the Japanese. The word origami means "folding paper" <br>
       (ori means "folding," and kami is "paper" in Japanese).<br><br>


      The origami butterfly has a simple but elegant look. Once <br>
      you learn how to make one, you won't want to stop. An <br>
      entire group of paper butterflies makes a wonderful wall <br>
      decoration. You can also use them to embellish handmade <br>
      cards, scrapbooks, and even as the finishing touch on gift wrapping.<br><br>
      
      
      You will need one sheet of square paper for each origami <br>
      butterfly. For a bold look, use solid colored paper. <br>
      If you'd like an elegant and traditional Japanese look, <br>
      try authentic washi paper. Washi paper is made in a <br>
      traditional manner and processed by hand from fibers <br>
      native to Japan. The fibers come from the inner bark of <br>
      the gampi tree, the mitsumata shrub, or the paper mulberry bush. <br>

    <p style="text-align: center;"  > 1: Start by folding diagonally, both ways, and then old the <br>
                                          paper in half, both ways. Fold all four corners into the center.

    <p></p>
    <p></p>


    <p style="text-align: center;" >2: Flip the paper over, and fold all four corners into the center. <br>
                                          Unfold the previous step and flip the model over <br>
                                          to the other side. Unfold the paper.

    <p></p>
    <p></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;" >3: Fold the right side into the center. Fold the left side to the center, too.<br><br>

      Holding the paper in the center, pull the right flap out to the right. <br>
      Pull the left flap out in the same way, and flatten the top section.

    <p></p>
    <p></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;" >4: Make the same right and left flaps for the bottom section. <br>
                                       Flatten what you have. It should look like a squat, rather <br>
                                       horizontal hexagon.<br><br>

      Fold the top section behind. Flatten the model. 
                                       
                                       </p>

    <p></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;" >5: Flip the right layer down. Flip the left flap down.<br> 
      Fold a small section inward where indicated. <br> 
      Fold the model in half to the right.

    <p style="text-align: center;" >6: Fold a small section over where shown. <br>
                                       Unfold the back layer to the left.<br>
                                        Reverse fold the left side of the fold you just created.
